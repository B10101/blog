Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes allows you to deploy and manage containerized applications in a scalable and efficient way, providing features like automated load balancing, rolling updates, and self-healing.

## Features of kubernetes
- Container Orchestration:
    1. Deployment Management: It automates the deployment of containerized applications.
    2. Scaling: It allows horizontal scaling by adding or removing instances of applications based on demand.
    3. Rolling Updates: IT enables the deployment of new versions of applications without downtime.
- Automated Load Balancing: It distributes incoming network traffic across multiple pods to ensure optimal resource utilization and high availability.
- Batch Execution: It supports batch and cron job execution for running jobs or tasks on the cluster.
