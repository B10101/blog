Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes allows you to deploy and manage containerized applications in a scalable and efficient way, providing features like automated load balancing, rolling updates, and self-healing.
